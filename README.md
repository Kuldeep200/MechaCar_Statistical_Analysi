Linear Regression to Predict MPG
The screenshot below shows the results of producing a linear regression model to predict MPG from the MechaCar_mpg dataset using the variables of vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance, and AWD. Of these variables, vehicle length and ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset, as shown by their low p-values.  This model predicts the mpg of MechaCar protoypes effectively because the Adjusted R-squared reflects that ~68.25% of the variation within mpg is explained by the coefficients.

Summary statistics of the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation of the PSI are shown below for the suspension coils overall and for the manufacturing lots. The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils presure the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch (PSI). Based on the variance of the suspension coils in the total summary, the suspension coils overall meet the MechaCar design specifications. However, the lot summary shows that while manufacturing Lots 1 and 2 meet the design specifications and have variances under 100 PSI, Lot 3 does not meet the design specifications as its variance is much over the 100 PSI limit.
